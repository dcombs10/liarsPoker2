            <h3>Liar's Dice Rules</h3>
            <ul class="ui list">
                <li>Each player receives four (4) dice to start the game</li>
                <li>Players take turns in sequential order (based on the order they joined the room)</li>
                <li>During a turn, a player may either (1) Bid (Submit Raise); or (2) Call</li>
                <ol class="ui list">
                    <li><strong>Bid</strong> - players can raise the current bid by increasing the value or quantity (or both) of the dice. Players can never reduce the value or quantity of the dice from the current bid</li>
                    <li><strong>Call</strong> - players can challenge the current bid by "calling", indicating the player does not believe that the current bid exists across all players' dice</li>
                </ol>
                <li>The hierarchy of dice values is shown in the image below, beginning with 2 as the lowest value, and 1 ("aces") as the highest value:</li>
                <img src="../images/diceValuesOrder.PNG" alt="" class="ui large image">
                <li>If all players have "called" (challenged) the current bid, the game will determine whether the bid exists</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the bid exists, then the player who submitted the bid wins the game outright, and their score increases 1 (all other players' scores will decrement 1)</li>
                    <li>If the bid does not exist, the player who made the call will "kick a die", but they will not lose a point unless they have run out of dice</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: some players play with "wilds". This variation of the game does not include any wild values.</p>
